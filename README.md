# Monitoring-and-Detecting-Cyber-Attacks-Based-on-Traffic-Data
SE495 Project

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview  
 
Cybersecurity threats are evolving at a very fast pace, becoming more complex and frequent. Threats such as botnets, DDoS attacks, and malicious traffic are becoming more sophisticated, thus posing greater risks to organizations and becoming more challenging for them to protect their systems. Thatâ€™s why it's very important for organizations to be able to  accurately detect and classify various types of cyberattacks in real-time, to ensure network security is maintained. The project aims to leverage machine learning models to monitor and detect cyberattacks using network traffic data and DNS information. By analyzing features like traffic duration, packet size, and timestamps, the models can classify traffic as normal or malicious and identify specific attack types.
